                <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                <p>
                dog, (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the gray
                wolf (Canis lupus) and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular
                domestic animals in the world (the cat is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a hunting
                companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend.
                
                The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating
                dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic engineering, dogs were bred to
                accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution
                of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts
                and created new breeds as need or desire arose.

                    Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather like a weasel,
                    lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called Miacis, the genus that became the ancestor of the
                    animals known today as canids: dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes. Miacis did not leave direct descendants, but doglike
                    canids evolved from it. By about 30 to 40 million years ago Miacis had evolved into the first true dog—namely,
                    Cynodictis. This was a medium-size animal, longer than it was tall, with a long tail and a fairly brushy coat. Over the
                    millennia Cynodictis gave rise to two branches, one in Africa and the other in Eurasia. The Eurasian branch was called
                    Tomarctus and is the progenitor of wolves, dogs, and foxes.
                    
                    Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves (Canis) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that
                    produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years
                    ago. The timing and location of dog domestication is a matter of debate. There is strong genetic evidence, however, that
                    the first domestication events occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. In this
                    region wolves likely facilitated their own domestication by trailing nomadic people in northern Eurasia and consuming
                    the remains of game animals that hunters left behind.

                <h2>Facts About Cats</h2>
                <p>
        The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only
        domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of
        the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a
        feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its
        retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick
        reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a
        solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring,
        trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting—as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
        frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
                </p>
                <p>
                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in
                equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events
                as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying
                and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats
                worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.
                
                As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and
                around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated
                population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million
                stray cats in the world.

                <h2>Facts About Snakes</h2>
                <p>
        Snakes are elongated limbless reptiles of the suborder Serpentes (/sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/).[2] Cladistically squamates, snakes
        are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales much like other members of the group. Many species of
        snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors and relatives, enabling them to swallow prey
        much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as
        kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species
        retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have independently evolved
        elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs at least twenty-five times via convergent evolution, leading
        to many lineages of legless lizards.[3] These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids
        and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and
        Pygopodidae).
                </p>
                <p>
Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some
large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the
Atlantic and central Pacific oceans.[4] Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific
oceans. Around thirty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about more than 4,170
species.[5] They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake[6] to the reticulated python of
6.95
